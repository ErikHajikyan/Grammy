Information about how the code is working
In our code by using linkedList we combined all the information which refers to Grammy and saved all its properties. The user can step by step get the Grammy winners, their songs and the years. After every winner the user should answer if he/she wants to add another winner or not. If the user types no, then our code is implementing step by step typing the winners. Hence, the code will give the user information about registered Grammy prize years.
